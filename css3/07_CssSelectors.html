    <p>Cloud computing has revolutionized the way we build and deploy software. Cloud-native development takes this a step further by leveraging the inherent capabilities of cloud platforms. This approach allows for:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="blue">* **Scalability and Agility:**  Cloud-native applications can easily scale up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal performance.</li>
        <li>* **Microservices Architecture:**  Applications are broken down into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.</li>
        <li>* **Faster Time to Market:**  Cloud-native development tools and processes streamline the development lifecycle, enabling developers to get products to market quicker.</li>
    </ul>
